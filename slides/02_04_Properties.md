You can modify properties of an HTML element using an angular directive called properties.

## Angular Events
- `[ PROP ]`
- Any element property
- Compared to expressions

- You can use the property syntax, which uses square brackets and helps you manage how data affects your code.

- You can replace any HTML tag property and that can bind the property to your component code.

- You might notice that you can do some of these things by using expressions, but properties can make sure that a property is processed before a component has been instantiated so content doesn't have loading issues. We'll take a look at an example.

## Conclusion
The ability to work with the property syntax is another way that Angular can help you control how your templates interact with your components.
