Hey there, it's Ray again... Thanks for watching this course.

Angular is a pretty awesome framework that will make your life easier...and although this is a pretty good introduction to the framework, there's a lot more to learn. If you're interested in taking what you learned further, take a look at our Become an Angular Developer learning path. By finishing this, you've already completed the first course in that learning path.

Of course, you should check out the official Angular website at angular.io. It has several sections including another tutorial you can follow and the fundamentals section, where you can dive deeper into other topics.

If you want to learn more about me, you can reach me at my personal site raybo.org or through twitter, github, linkedIn or about any other social media network @planetoftheweb.

Once again thanks for watching this course...and don't stop learning.
