# Learn Angular
Sub-components

> > Author Notes:
In a regular application, it's better to create more than one component to separate what's happening in an application into different pieces. That makes them easier to update and work with, so let's take a look.

## Generating Components
- Use the CLI
- Props to pass vars
- Inputs/Imports

> > Author Notes:

- Although you can do things manually, there's a lot of little connections you have to make which are very precise, so the CLI will make that process much easier.

- In order to make the two components communicate with each other, we can use properties, sometimes called props...which use the square brackets to pass along something from the main component to the sub-component.

- There's some other wiring that we'll need to do including adding an inputs field to our sub-component and importing between the files.

## Conclusion
Separating the functionality of your application makes working with components easier to update and helps you build applications that are more efficient.
