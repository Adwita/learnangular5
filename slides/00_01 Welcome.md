# Introduction
Hi there, this is Ray Villalobos Senior Staff Instructor...welcome to this course.

This is a project based introduction to working with the Angular Framework. This covers the newere version of Angular, not the older version now known as AngularJS or Angular 1.

I'll start by showing you how to work with the CLI...the Command Line Interface that will help you set up Angular projects quickly. I'll go over structure of Angular projects, and show you how to customize things. Plus, I'll show you how to install additional frameworks like Bootstrap and jQuery.

Next, well take a look at working with templates in Angular, including showing how you can bind data as well as events, which allow you to handle click events in your applications. We'll take a look at properties and the more advanced two way data-binding that's available for form elements.

Finally, I'll show you how to use Lifecycle methods to import external JSON documents and working with multiple components, which includes learning to pass data between components and sub-components. I'll also show you how to filter content using custom pipes.

This course is designed as a project based course that will show you a practical way to use Angular by building a component based application that takes care of a common task...doing a live search.

There's a lot to learn, but that's why you're here, so let's get started.
