# Learn Angular
What is Angular?

> > Author Notes: Before we get started, let's take a  quick look at what Angular is and what we'll be building in this course.

## Angular

- App Framework
- Two versions
- Component Based
- Modular

> > Author Notes: Angular is an application framework, which means a method for structuring your code that makes it easier to build application using web technologies.

- There are two versions of the Angular framework. Angular 1 also known as AngularJS and this version of angular, which means anything after angular 1, which can be anything greater than angular 2. As of this video, Angular is on Angular 5.

- Angular...not AngularJS is a component based framework, which means that the main way you build code is by creating smaller pieces of code and then putting them together. Each piece can contain it's own scripts, templates and css and can talk to other components.

- In that way, Angular is modular, and that means that you don't just build small components yourself, but that in order to use different features of the framework you load up only the components you need. That makes this framework fast and efficient.

## Features

- Data Binding
- Templates
- CLI

> > Author Notes: One of the key features of the framework is something called data-binding. This involves learning how to connect your templates, which are sometimes called models, to your information, which is sometimes called models or data.

Angular has a rich template system that looks like HTML with some additional formats for attributes and even tags that you build and define yourself. It's pretty easy to pick up and work with.

Making this connections manually can be challenging, so Angular provides a CLI or command line interface. This is a little application that you install and load with your terminal that makes it easier to install and connect your different components. In the rest of this chapter, we'll take a look at how the CLI works.


Let's take a quick look at what we're going to be building.

This is a pretty simple, but practical project, a directory search application that will help you practice the core principles of Angular and it's something you'll probably use in a lot of projects...a dynamic live search application. In building this application, we'll learn all about the CLI, components, the templating system and cross-component communication. So if you're ready to get started, we'll take a look at the CLI in the next video.
