# Learn Angular
Two-way binding

> > Author Notes:
You already know how to bind an event to your component and also how to use a property to modify an HTML element. Angular provides a way to do both at the same time. This technique is known as two way data binding.

## Two-way Data Binding
- [( ngModel )]
- [( ngControl )]
- Additional imports

> > Author Notes:

- There are two different notations for accessing two way data binding. The first allows you to track the value of input fields and it's called ngModel.

- The second is for form elements that are not input fields like checkboxes.

- In order to use these we're going to need to import a separate module that gives you some additional abilities for form elements.

## Conclusion
Two way data binding is specially useful for forms and provides a powerful way to track changes on form elements.
